# FACTORY HACK KOREA 2025 - Forbao

## üìå Project Overview
This project was developed for an **Industrial AI Hackathon** aimed at solving **manufacturing site issues**.  
We built an **AI-powered quality prediction and monitoring system** for **milling machine processes**, allowing real-time defect prediction and explanation of influential factors.

## üöÄ Main Objectives
- Predict defects occurring mid-process
- Enable real-time data monitoring and quality forecasting
- Identify key factors influencing defect occurrence and provide interpretable insights

## üîç Problem Definition
- **Automotive ball lamp manufacturing process** experiences a surge in defect rates when machining specific holes
- Process interruptions and manual inspections lower productivity
- **A defect prediction and root cause analysis system** is needed to improve quality and efficiency

## üìä Data Overview
- **7 Key Variables**: Feed rate (ActF), spindle speed, spindle load, servo motor load, servo motor current, tool usage count (TotalCount), and other sensor data
- Data collected in **0.1-second and 0.5-second intervals**, aligned at **0.5-second resolution** for processing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted to investigate defect distributions and key influencing factors
